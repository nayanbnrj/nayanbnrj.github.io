I am a BS-MS student majoring in Chemistry at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), India. I have a strong passion to solve real world problems amalgamating the knowledge of chemistry and biology. My vision is to utilize chemistry as a central science to orchestrate unchartered reactivity in molecules translating to technological and/or therapeutic relevance.

I have garnered a broad spectra of research experiences during my undergraduate years. During the most part of my stay at IACS, I worked in the RadCat group at IACS, led by Prof. Joyram Guin, to explored photoredox chemistry. We leveraged sulfonyl-oxime-ethers into a new bifunctional species for a metal-free oximesulfonylation protocol for olefins. My knowledge in chemical biology was supplemented by my summer REU project at the University of Minnesota, where I worked with Prof. William Pomerantz to design a new class of heterocyclic BRD selective inhibitors, followed by their biophysical screening. My previous internship at Prof. Taehyung Kim's Lab at the University of New Mexico provided me exposure into understanding molecular biology  especially in relvance to mechanobiology of the tumor micro-environment. 

I have spent the most of my life in Kolkata, India , being surrounded by a rich cultural diversity and spirit of celebrating humanity. Growing up in the heart of this 'city of joy', I acknowledge kindness and compassion are indispensabe to any avenue of life. Now that I am actively applying for graduate schools abroad, the thought of leaving my family behind and not being able to witness Durga Puja on the threshold of winter, haunts me quite a bit.
